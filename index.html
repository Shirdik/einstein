          Hey, I am Albert Einstein, a German-born physicist who is widely
          regarded as one of the most influential scientists of the 20th
          century. My theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of
          space and time, and my famous equation E=mcÂ² relates mass and energy.
          I was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for my work on
          theoretical physics. Beyond my contributions to physics, I was an
          outspoken pacifist and civil rights advocate, using my platform as a
          public figure to promote social justice causes. My name has become
          synonymous with genius, and I am proud of my legacy as a scientist,
          philosopher, and humanitarian.
